# No-Market-Injections (NoSQL Injection Lab)

A NoSQL Injection Lab developed with NodeJS and Express JS to understand and practice NoSQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **NodeJS:** 20.0
- **ExpressJS:** 4.19.2
- **MongoDB:** 6.8
- **Nodemon:** 3.1.4
- **jsonwebtoken:** 9.0.2

## Requirements

- NodeJS 20.0 or higher
- MongoDB 6.8
- Jsonwebtoken 9.0 or higher
- Nodemon 3.0 or higher
- ExpressJS 4.0 or higher

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EdsonSaldivar/No-Market-Injections.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd No-Market-Injections
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
